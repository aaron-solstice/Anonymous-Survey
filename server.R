          <li>Our ability to collaborate, trust, and treat each other with respect will be the key to future success. </li>

<p>The unbridled optimism from the last anonymous survey contrasts with the challenge of
building an innovative movie studio. Follow our initial honeymoon period, there was only one way for the
scores to go in a subsequent survey. While employees in believe Solstice is a positive
environment, with mutual admiration for the level of talent working here; appreciation for management's clear
communication and transparency, and an innate ability to get things done; we are now facing
growing pains, coming to terms with our roles, responsibilities, limitations, and sense of
freedom to work in a way we see fit.</p>
 
<p>On the positive side, there's a general recognition that Solstice will do whatever it takes to
survive--we are scrappy and able to adapt quickly. At this point, many of us would like to see a greater focus on
maintaining our core values of psychological safety, trust, and employee
empowerment.</p>

<p>There were two clear and related ideas within the open-end questions that we should consider
addressing. The first is the hours physically spent in the office, where people say they believe
they can perform better if they have more flexibility to recharge, connect with and care for our
children, family, friends, and pets. The second is they feel they can be more productive if they
were empowered to act more independently. These two ideas are related more generally to
the notion that we want the freedom to perform *when* we feel we can be at our best, and
also *how* we feel itâ€™s best to carry out our duties.</p>
